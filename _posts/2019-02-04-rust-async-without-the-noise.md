title: osaka.rs - rust async without the noise
---

this post has received too much exposure for the wrong reasons and was retracted.

thanks for the feedback. it's pretty clear that i won't ever be able to reach
the expected communication standard to get to the technical discussion that i feel is necessary.

There's nothing to gain from more heated debate about tone and language, so there will simply not be a follow up article.

I've got electric cars to ship, and for now they'll surely run rust, specifically [osaka](https://github.com/aep/osaka). :)
